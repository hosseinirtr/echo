## üìÑ Temporary Documentation ‚Äì *Echo: Intelligent Multi-Drone System with a Custom Network*

### 1. Project Overview

**Echo** is an intelligent multi-drone system based on a custom communication network. The goal is to simulate and later deploy a distributed system of drones capable of communication, coordination, and intelligent behavior in a decentralized manner.

The system includes:

* A **custom decentralized network architecture**
* Development of different classes of **physical drones**
* A **modular software framework** written in **Rust** and **Python**
* **Computer vision** for autonomous navigation and scene understanding
* **Graph-based machine learning** for swarm intelligence and optimization

### 2. Network Topology and Node Types

The system is modeled as a dynamic graph consisting of three types of nodes:

| Node Type             | Role and Characteristics                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Central Node**      | Management servers handling decision-making, mission assignment, and global coordination.                                     |
| **Intermediate Node** | Medium/large drones that relay signals and support other drones. Equipped with extended battery life and networking boosters. |
| **Active Node**        | Lightweight drones that only receive and execute commands. Minimal processing, optimized for battery and agility.             |

> All drones are part of a **mesh-based graph network** with dynamic routing and limited range communication.
